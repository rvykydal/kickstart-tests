# This is actually testing application of kickstart network commands in
# anaconda (which would normally be triggered by defining networking in %pre
# and %including it into kickstart).  It is caused by network kickstart
# commands not being applied in dracut because for ks=file:/ks.cfg (kickstart
# injected in initrd) network devices are not found in sysfs in the time of
# parsing the kickstart.

# This test is relevant only for RHEL7, the legacy options are not supported
# in Fedora (as of now).
